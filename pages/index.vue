          Lately I've been working on getting my experience up with backend projects, as I feel that I've got the frontend experience needed to make just about anything.

          The biggest project being a discord bot, Anna, I have linked in the header, using technologies such as <Fancy>Docker</Fancy> for production deployment, <Fancy>Typescript</Fancy> as the language, <Fancy>SQLite</Fancy> for the database, and finally <Fancy>Nuxt</Fancy> for the dashboard. I've been proudly working on Anna for the greater half of a year.

          <Fancy>Programming takes up a lot of my personal interest and time</Fancy>, alongside reading, playing video games, and socialising with my friends. I pride myself on being a patient and persistent type of person, working on a task until completion, much to the dismay of my attention to things like eating and taking breaks.
