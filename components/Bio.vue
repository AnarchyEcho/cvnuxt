      Lately I've been working on upgrading my expertise in backend with <NuxtLink to="https://www.boot.dev/" target="_blank">Boot.Dev&#10548;</NuxtLink> and <NuxtLink to="https://www.noroff.no/studier/fagskole/backend-utvikling-2-aarig" target="_blank">Noroff&#10548;</NuxtLink>, as I feel that I've got the frontend expertise needed to make just about anything.

    <p>
      The biggest project being a discord bot, <NuxtLink to="https://anna.echodev.sh">Anna&#10548;</NuxtLink>, I have linked in the header, using technologies such as <Fancy>Docker</Fancy> for production deployment, <Fancy>Typescript</Fancy> as the language, <Fancy>SQLite</Fancy> for the database, and finally <Fancy>Nuxt</Fancy> for the dashboard. I've been proudly working on <NuxtLink to="https://anna.echodev.sh">Anna&#10548;</NuxtLink> for about a year.

      <Fancy>Programming takes up a lot of my personal interest and time</Fancy>, alongside reading, playing video games, and socialising with my friends. I would describe myself as being a patient and persistent type of person, working on a task until completion, sometimes to a fault.
